Question 1: Split proportion is incorrect (should be 80/20, not 70/30 as implemented): -3,
Pipeline only wraps the model; preprocessing not done inside pipeline: -5, 
Does not compute days-since-join correctly; uses today’s date instead of dataset reference date: -4,
Only MSE is reported; rubric requires two measures (MSE/MAE/RMSE/ R²), Interpretation missing: -3,
CV computed correctly, but no interpretation: -1,
Best parameters and best score not printed: -2

Question 2: No linear regression model, no comparison, no interpretation: -10
Question 3: Pipeline built incorrectly: categorical encoding missing; numeric scaling missing, Residual steps incomplete, Classification report is correct, but preprocessing errors affect model validity: -4
